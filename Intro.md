**Project Overview**

*Motivation*

This project seeks to improve Intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement which is crucial for Glaucoma monitoring. Current IOP measurements rely on Cornea applanation techniques which involves direct contact with the cornea. Direct contact with cornea for IOP measurement can be umcomfortable for people. Hence, this project seeks to achieve IOP measurement through indirect cornea contact, over the eyelids when the patient's eyes are closed.

*Currrent technique under exploration*

A mechanical actuator device (Still under development) with our in-house developed tactile sensor attached, will be used to contact with the patient's closed eyes, with a controlled force, speed and indentation displacement. An artificial eye with IOP as the control variable is set up, where sensor readings corresponding to different IOP levels are collected. These sensor readings together with the IOP labels are then passed through Machine Learning (ML) for us to predict unknown IOPs from sensor readings obtained through the aforementioned mechanical actuation method.

*DISCLAIMER*

The datasets collected, mechanical actuator design and sensor for this project belong to Tee Research group, National University of Singapore and are not available for public sharing. This repository only seeks to share how tactile sensing data can be processed for Machine learning/AI classification tasks. This project is a continuation from the international James Dyson award winning project, Hopes, aka Home Eye Pressure E-skin Sensor (https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/parenting-education/nus-students-win-top-international-james-dyson-award-with-glaucoma)
